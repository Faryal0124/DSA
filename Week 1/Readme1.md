This file contains multiple C++ examples and exercises covering various object-oriented programming (OOP) and template programming concepts. Below is an overview of the key concepts demonstrated in the code:

### **1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts**
- **Example 1.2 (Complex Number Class)**  
  - Demonstrates **constructors**, **destructors**, **operator overloading** (`+` and `=`), and **member functions** to handle complex numbers.
  - Uses **dynamic memory allocation** for object creation.

### **2. Function Templates and Class Templates**
- **Example 1.3 (Function Template: GetMax)**  
  - Shows how **function templates** can be used to find the maximum of two values of any data type.
  
- **Example 1.4 (Class Template: Pair)**  
  - Defines a **class template** for handling two values and finding the maximum between them.
  
- **Exercise 1.2 (Extending Class Template: Pair with getMin)**  
  - Extends the previous example by adding a `getmin()` function to find the minimum value.

- **Example 1.5 & Exercise 1.4 (Class Template with Arrays)**  
  - Implements a **class template** that manages an array with methods to set and get values.
  - Includes methods to find the **maximum** and **minimum** values in the array.

### **3. File Handling (Reading & Writing Files)**
- **Exercise 1.6 (Counting Characters, Words, and Sentences from a File)**  
  - Reads a file (`fin.txt`), counts **characters, words, and sentences**, and writes the results to another file (`practice.txt`).
  
- **Example 1.7 (Processing Student Grades from a File)**  
  - Reads student names and their marks from a file (`input.dat`), calculates the **average score**, and writes it to another file (`output.dat`).

### **4. Classes and Objects (House Class Example)**
- **Exercise 1.5 (House Data Management)**  
  - Implements a class `House` to store details like **owner, address, bedrooms, and price**.
  - Demonstrates **taking user input** for multiple objects and **displaying** the stored data.

### **Key Programming Concepts Covered**
- **Constructors & Destructors**: Managing object initialization and cleanup.
- **Operator Overloading**: Defining custom behavior for operators (`+`, `=`).
- **Function & Class Templates**: Creating generic functions and classes for reusability.
- **File Handling**: Reading and writing data to files.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Using `new` and `delete` to manage memory.
- **Encapsulation**: Using private and public access specifiers in classes.

This file serves as a great reference for C++ beginners learning OOP, templates, and file handling.

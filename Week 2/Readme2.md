# Stack Implementation in C++

This repository provides a C++ implementation of the stack data structure and demonstrates its practical applications. The code showcases multiple variations of the stack class, handling different data types and memory management techniques. Additionally, it illustrates how stacks can be used to solve common problems such as string reversal, checking balanced parentheses, converting infix expressions to postfix, and evaluating postfix expressions.

## Overview
A stack is a key data structure that operates on the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. This project provides a comprehensive implementation of stacks in C++, exploring different approaches for defining and utilizing them. The included examples highlight the effectiveness of stacks in solving real-world computational problems.

## Stack Variants
The repository features multiple stack implementations:

### Basic Stack (stack1.h/cpp)
A simple stack that operates on integer data types, supporting push and pop operations.

### Stack with Peek Function (stack1.h/cpp)
An extension of the basic stack, allowing the user to view the top element without removing it.

### Character Stack (stack1.h/cpp)
A stack specifically designed to store characters, useful for tasks involving string manipulation.

### Template-Based Stack (stack1.h/cpp)
A generalized stack implementation utilizing templates, enabling it to handle various data types dynamically.

### Character Stack with Error Handling (stack1.h/cpp)
An enhanced version of the character stack that incorporates error handling mechanisms for overflow and underflow conditions.

## Applications
The repository includes programs demonstrating stack usage in solving different computational problems:

### Demonstration of Stack Operations (main.cpp)
A simple program that illustrates fundamental stack operations like push, pop, and displaying elements.

### String Reversal (main.cpp)
Utilizes a stack to reverse a given string efficiently.

### Parentheses Validation (main.cpp)
Checks whether an expression contains properly balanced parentheses using a stack.

### Infix to Postfix Conversion & Evaluation (main.cpp)
Converts an infix mathematical expression to postfix notation using a stack and evaluates the postfix expression.

## Compilation & Execution
To compile and run the programs, ensure that a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) is installed. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the source files.
2. Compile the code. For instance, to build the infix to postfix converter:
   ```sh
   g++ main.cpp stack1.cpp -o infix_postfix
   ```
3. Execute the compiled program:
   ```sh
   ./infix_postfix
   ```

Modify the compilation command as needed for different applications.

## Directory Structure
- `stack1.h/cpp` - Header and implementation files for stack variants
- `main.cpp` - Contains example applications demonstrating stack usage
- `README.md` - Documentation for the repository

## Code Explanation
The repository provides detailed implementations of stack-based algorithms, showcasing how stacks can efficiently manage data.

## Potential Enhancements
Future improvements may include:
- Adding more robust exception handling.
- Implementing a dynamic stack with automatic resizing.
- Extending applications to solve additional computational problems using stacks.
